## Version 2.0 — Evidence Tag Registry & Artifact Reuse
Date: June 19, 2026

### Evidence Tags
- Added controlled evidence tag taxonomy — 66 tags across 17 categories covering all 14 CMMC control families
- All 320 assessment objectives now have expected evidence tag mappings (one objective intentionally waived: IA.L2-3.5.11[a])
- Tags classify artifact evidence types; they do not make scoring, compliance, or pass/fail determinations

### Artifact Tag Editing
- Artifact evidence tags are now editable from the Artifact Map via a modal tag picker
- Artifact evidence tags are also editable from ControlDetail artifact suggestion modals
- Evidence tag picker modal supports search, category browsing, checkbox selection, and removable chip selections
- Assigned-tags chip area shows at the top of the picker with individual chip X-removal

### ControlDetail — Suggested Existing Artifacts
- Each assessment objective now surfaces a collapsed list of existing artifacts from related controls
- Suggestions are relationship-gated: only controls linked via `evidence_reuse` relationships contribute candidates
- Suggestions are tag-aware: tag alignment is computed against the target objective's expected tags and used to rank and label candidates
- Tags explain and rank suggestions — they do not filter or suppress candidates
- Tag-only discovery (surfacing artifacts with no relationship backing) remains deferred

### Artifact Map — Tag-Gated Reuse Opportunities
- Tagged artifacts show a collapsed Potential Reuse Opportunities section sourced from existing relationship data
- Untagged artifacts show a compact prompt inside the evidence tags card; Potential Reuse Opportunities section is hidden
- Untagged artifact titles are visually highlighted in red
- Reuse pagination: 5 candidates per page with range display ("Showing 1–5 of N") and Previous/Next controls
- No tag-only candidate discovery added; relationship gating remains the source of truth

### ControlDetail — Common Artifacts UI
- Common Artifacts section is no longer shown in the ControlDetail UI
- Underlying Common Artifacts data is preserved in full; search indexing and Evidence Lookup remain unaffected

### Code Quality
- ControlDetail and ArtifactMap lint debt resolved
- Removed unused ArtifactTagEditor component

### Validation
- Controls: 110
- Objectives: 320
- Evidence Types: 130
- Evidence Tags: 66 (17 categories)
- Relationships: 189
- Families: 14/14
- Validator: Pass (4 pre-existing relationship warnings, unchanged)

### Deployment Status
- Status: Production
- GitHub: https://github.com/Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion
- Cloudflare Pages: https://cmmc-companion.pages.dev

### Notes
No changes to scoring logic, assessment status behavior, control definitions, relationship definitions, or validator rules. Evidence tags are guidance-only classification aids. No compliance claims, satisfaction determinations, or pass/fail language added to tag or reuse UI.

## Version 1.1.2 — Assessment Workflow & Disclosure Update
Date: June 4, 2026

### Assessment Workflow
- Auto-resizing textareas — Assessment Notes and all Objective Notes in ControlDetail now expand automatically as content grows and shrink when content is removed; no internal scrollbar during normal use; implemented via a reusable `AutoResizeTextarea` component (`src/components/AutoResizeTextarea.jsx`)
- Auto-status promotion — typing into any note field on a Not Started control automatically promotes it to In Progress; implemented via `syncAutoStatus()` helper in ControlDetail.jsx
- Auto-status demotion — clearing all note fields on an In Progress control automatically reverts it to Not Started; evaluated across Assessment Notes and all Objective Notes together
- Auto-status guards — MET and NOT MET statuses are never modified by auto-promotion or demotion; only Not Started ↔ In Progress transitions are automatic; manual dropdown changes are unaffected
- Hide MET controls toggle — Control Library now includes a persistent checkbox to hide MET controls from the list; preference stored in localStorage (`cmmc-hide-met-controls`); helper text displayed when active; if the Status filter is explicitly set to MET, MET controls are shown regardless of toggle; toggle is not reset by Clear Filters

### Legal & Ownership
- Added Copyright & Ownership section to About page — copyright notice, proprietary software statement, unauthorized use prohibition
- Added Independence & Affiliation subsection to About page — six-point disclosure establishing independence from C3PAOs, The Cyber AB, DIBCAC, DoD, NIST, and government agencies; clarifying that use does not constitute an official assessment or compliance determination
- Added copyright footer to Home page — muted line beneath version information
- Added affiliation FAQ entry to FAQ page — positioned second (directly after official-assessment-tool question) to address primary reviewer concern early

### Infrastructure
- No changes to data files, control definitions, evidence mappings, relationship definitions, scoring metadata, routing, validator, or export/import logic

### Validation
- Controls: 110
- Evidence Types: 130
- Relationships: 189
- Families: 14/14
- Validator: Pass

### Deployment Status
- Status: Production
- GitHub: https://github.com/Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion
- Cloudflare Pages: https://cmmc-companion.pages.dev

### Notes
No assessment data was modified. All changes are UI behavior, component architecture, and legal disclosure additions. The `AutoResizeTextarea` component is the only new file introduced.

## Version 1.1.1 — Production Readiness, Security & Usability Update
Date: June 3, 2026

### Assessment Workflow
- Fixed bulk status update functionality — `writeStatus` import was missing, silently preventing all bulk writes to localStorage
- Added Clear Data confirmation dialog — explicit modal listing exactly what will and will not be cleared before any data is modified
- Improved Home page assessment progress dashboard — replaced vertical status summary list with a 2×2 status card grid
- Added status card grid with count, percentage, and status color treatment per card
- All status cards remain clickable — link to Control Library filtered by status and family

### Import & Export
- Added OSC / Client Name and Assessment Name prompts before CSV and JSON exports
- Added timestamped filenames (`YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` using local browser time) to prevent same-day collisions
- Added Project Backup tracking — Home page displays time of last successful JSON export
- Added CSV import validation: `.csv` extension required, MIME allowlist, 1 MB size limit
- Added JSON import validation: `.json` extension required, MIME allowlist, 2 MB size limit
- Added JSON restore confirmation dialog — lists exactly what will and will not be overwritten before any data is modified; Cancel discards pending import with no side effects
- Added pre-validation of JSON schema and version before showing the restore dialog
- Added import/export section descriptions to Home page for first-time user orientation
- Added Tip line distinguishing CSV (progress sharing) from JSON (full backup and recovery)

### Security & Privacy
- Reworked About page — replaced separate Data & Privacy and Limitations sections with a consolidated Data Handling, Privacy & Limitations section covering: Intended Use, Not Intended For, Storage Architecture, Export Responsibility, Limitations, and Important notice
- Added explicit guidance that CUI, SSPs, network diagrams, system inventories, device configurations, screenshots, and sensitive customer documentation should not be stored in the application
- Clarified that no assessment data is transmitted to the developer, GitHub, or Cloudflare
- Clarified user responsibility for handling and distributing exported files
- Added FAQ page covering: official tool status, server storage model, CUI policy, multi-assessor sharing, browser data loss, import transmission, import protections, export format differences, internet access requirements, dataset update cadence, tool origin, data encryption posture, and external file sharing responsibility

### User Experience
- Added light/dark theme toggle with localStorage persistence and flash prevention on hard refresh
- Theme toggle placed on Home page footer row alongside deep link
- Navigation bar locked to permanently dark in both themes for consistent visual identity
- Added export/import descriptions directly beneath each button group on the Home page
- Added backup status indicator (Last Project Backup: date or Never)
- Added application version and deployment environment display on Home page
- Added FAQ page to navigation between About and Changelog

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- First GitHub production release: https://github.com/Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion
- First Cloudflare Pages deployment: https://cmmc-companion.pages.dev
- Automatic CI/CD deployment from `main` branch verified
- `public/_redirects` (`/* /index.html 200`) confirmed working for SPA deep-link routing
- Deployment tracking added to PROJECT_STATE.md

### Documentation
- Added dedicated FAQ page (`/faq`) addressing supervisor and security-review concerns
- Expanded About page with structured compliance-oriented guidance
- Updated PROJECT_STATE.md version history
- Improved CHANGELOG structure and release tracking

### Maintenance
- Removed unused legacy `.status-summary`, `.status-summary-row`, `.status-summary-link` CSS after grid migration
- Added `src/utils/version.js` as single source of truth for version and deployment constant
- Added `src/utils/theme.js` for localStorage-backed theme management
- Added `src/utils/exportMeta.js` for export naming, backup timestamp, and filename sanitization
- General codebase hardening and UI consistency improvements

### Validation
- Controls: 110
- Evidence Types: 130
- Relationships: 189
- Families: 14/14
- Validator: Pass

### Deployment Status
- Status: Production
- GitHub: https://github.com/Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion
- Cloudflare Pages: https://cmmc-companion.pages.dev

### Notes
This release focuses on production readiness, import safety, privacy guidance, usability improvements, and deployment maturity rather than new assessment content. No control data, evidence mappings, relationship definitions, or scoring metadata were modified.

## Version 1.1.1 — Import Hardening and Export Improvements
Date: June 3, 2026

### Summary
Defensive-depth hardening of the CSV and JSON import pipeline. Extension-first file validation, size limits, and a restore confirmation dialog for JSON imports prevent accidental misuse and address supervisor and security-review concerns about file handling. Export filenames now include a local-time `HHMM` component to prevent same-day collisions.

### Features Added
- **JSON restore confirmation dialog** — importing a project backup now shows a confirmation dialog before overwriting any data. The dialog lists exactly what will and will not be affected and confirms that files are processed locally and not uploaded to a server. Cancel discards the pending import with no side effects.
- **Export filename timestamps** — filenames now include `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` using local browser time. Multiple exports on the same day no longer collide.

### Fixes / Hardening
- **CSV import: extension validation** — files must have a `.csv` extension; files without it are rejected even if the MIME type is `text/plain`
- **CSV import: MIME type validation** — accepted MIME types: `text/csv`, `application/csv`, `application/vnd.ms-excel`, `text/plain`, empty string (for browsers that do not populate `file.type`); all others rejected with a clear error message
- **CSV import: size limit** — files larger than 1 MB are rejected before reading
- **JSON import: extension validation** — files must have a `.json` extension; files without it are rejected even if the MIME type is `text/plain`
- **JSON import: MIME type validation** — accepted MIME types: `application/json`, `text/plain`, empty string; all others rejected
- **JSON import: size limit** — files larger than 2 MB are rejected before reading
- **JSON import: pre-validation before dialog** — schema version and structural checks run before the confirmation dialog appears; malformed files surface errors immediately without prompting

### Infrastructure
- No changes to data files, routing, validator, theme system, or deployment configuration

### Validation
- Controls: 110
- Evidence Types: 130
- Relationships: 189
- Families: 14/14
- Validator: Pass

### Deployment Status
- GitHub: Yes
- Cloudflare Pages: Yes — auto-deploys on push to `main`

### Notes
Extension is the primary validation control. MIME type is browser-determined and inconsistent across platforms; a `.txt` file will not pass as a `.csv` or `.json` regardless of its MIME type. Size limits (1 MB CSV / 2 MB JSON) are orders of magnitude larger than any legitimate CMMC Companion export (~15 KB for a full 110-control JSON backup).

---

## Version 1.0.1 — First Production Deployment
Date: June 3, 2026

### Summary
First production deployment of CMMC Companion. GitHub repository established, Cloudflare Pages configured, and CI/CD pipeline verified. Includes a bug fix that corrected a silent failure in the bulk Clear Data and bulk Set Status actions.

### Fixes
- **Bulk Clear Data was silently broken** — `writeStatus` was never imported in `ControlLibrary.jsx`; calls to it in `bulkClearData` and `bulkSetStatus` threw a `ReferenceError` at runtime and wrote nothing to localStorage. Added `writeStatus` to the existing status import.
- **Bulk Set Status was silently broken** — same root cause; fixed by the same import correction.
- **Clear Data had no confirmation guard** — clicking Clear Data immediately discarded all selected control data with no warning. Added a confirmation dialog before any data is modified.

### Features Added
- **Clear Data confirmation dialog** — modal overlay with explicit description of what will and will not be cleared: status, inheritance, control notes, and objective notes are reset; scoring metadata, POA&M eligibility, control definitions, evidence, and relationships are untouched. Buttons: Cancel (no-op) and Clear Data (confirms and executes).

### Infrastructure
- GitHub repository connected: `Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion`
- Cloudflare Pages project configured: framework preset Vite, build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`
- `public/_redirects` (`/* /index.html 200`) confirmed working — SPA deep-link routing verified on Cloudflare Pages
- Automatic deployment pipeline verified: push to `main` triggers build and deploy
- Production deployment from commit `85ee67d` verified successful

### Validation
- Controls: 110
- Evidence Types: 130
- Relationships: 189
- Families: 14/14
- Validator: Pass (4 pre-existing bidirectional relationship warnings, unchanged)

### Deployment Status
- GitHub: Yes — https://github.com/Vinchyyyy/cmmc-companion
- Cloudflare Pages: Yes
- Production URL: https://cmmc-companion.pages.dev

### Notes
The `writeStatus` import omission was a silent failure — no console error surfaced in development because the function was never called via a code path that would throw visibly. Both `bulkClearData` and `bulkSetStatus` were affected. The other three bulk write utilities (`writeInheritance`, `writeNote`, `writeObjectiveNote`) were imported correctly and functioned normally. The confirmation dialog uses a CSS overlay pattern consistent with existing bulk toolbar styles; no new dependencies introduced.

## [V1 Stabilization — P1 Batch]

### Fixed — Quick Search: Scoring Metadata Now Searchable
- `getScoringSearchTerms()` from `src/utils/scoring.js` wired into `searchControls()` in `Home.jsx`
- Quick Search now matches scoring-related terms: `"basic"`, `"derived"`, `"5 point"`, `"3 point"`, `"1 point"`, `"poam"`, `"non poam"`, `"conditional"`, and others defined in `getScoringSearchTerms()`
- One file changed: `src/pages/Home.jsx` (import + one additional `||` clause in `searchControls()`)
- Validator: all checks passed — 110 controls, 130 evidence types, 189 relationships (4 warnings, unchanged)

### Investigated — EvidenceLookup Physical Protection Filter
- Investigated the known issue: "EvidenceLookup PE filter not returning results"
- Finding: filter was already working correctly
- Root cause of original report: malformed JSX option labels for Personnel Security and Physical Protection were fixed during PE family integration; no additional code change was needed
- `matchesFamily()` correctly uses `familyById[id] === familyFilter` where `familyById` is built from the controls index; all PE control IDs map to `"Physical Protection"` and the dropdown `value` matches exactly
- Known issue closed with no code change

## [Post-Feature-Freeze Expansion] — Sessions 2–N

### Added — Media Protection (MP) Family — V1 FINAL FAMILY
- 9 controls confirmed from CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2 (pages 152–168):
  MP.L1-3.8.3 (Media Disposal), MP.L2-3.8.1 (Media Protection), MP.L2-3.8.2 (Media Access),
  MP.L2-3.8.4 (Media Markings), MP.L2-3.8.5 (Media Accountability), MP.L2-3.8.6 (Portable Storage Encryption),
  MP.L2-3.8.7 (Removable Media), MP.L2-3.8.8 (Shared Media), MP.L2-3.8.9 (Protect Backups)
- **PROJECT_STATE.md mismatch corrected:** Range described as "MP.L2-3.8.1 through MP.L2-3.8.9" implied MP.L2-3.8.3 exists — it does not. The L1 practice 3.8.3 carries the **MP.L1-3.8.3** designation (FAR Clause 52.204-21 b.1.vii). No MP.L2-3.8.3 exists. Count (~9) was correct.
- **MP.L1-3.8.3 ID decision:** Assessment Guide is authoritative. Scoring Methodology references "MP.L2-3.8.3" loosely in the 5-point basic list but the correct ID is MP.L1-3.8.3.
- Scoring (all confirmed from CMMC Scoring Methodology):
  - MP.L1-3.8.3: -5 Basic (listed as "MP.L2-3.8.3" in methodology — same practice, L1 ID is authoritative)
  - MP.L2-3.8.1: -3 Basic
  - MP.L2-3.8.2: -3 Basic
  - MP.L2-3.8.4: -1 Derived
  - MP.L2-3.8.5: -1 Derived
  - MP.L2-3.8.6: -1 Derived
  - MP.L2-3.8.7: -5 Derived
  - MP.L2-3.8.8: -3 Derived
  - MP.L2-3.8.9: -1 Derived
- POA&M: all 9 MP controls allowed — none appear in the prohibited POA&M list
- 8 MP-specific evidence types
- 7 intra-MP relationship edges
- 7 cross-family edges: MP↔MA (×1, deferred edge now added), MP↔SI (×1), MP↔SC (×2), MP↔PE (×1), MP↔AC (×2)
- **Deferred MA→MP edge added:** MA.L2-3.7.3 → MP.L1-3.8.3 (both use NIST 800-88 sanitization; deferred from MA expansion pending MP controls)
- MP added to all four family dropdowns: ControlLibrary.jsx, Home.jsx, EvidenceLookup.jsx, RelationshipExplorer.jsx
- MP registered in validator: FAMILY_FILES, FAMILY_CODE_TO_NAME, RELATIONSHIP_FILES, EVIDENCE_FILES
- Validator passes: 110 controls, 130 evidence types, 189 relationships (4 bidirectional warnings only)
- **All 14 CMMC Level 2 control families now complete. V1 control coverage done.**

### Added — Awareness and Training (AT) Family
- 2 controls: AT.L2-3.2.1 (Role-Based Risk Awareness), AT.L2-3.2.2 (Role-Based Training)
- Control IDs and titles confirmed against CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2 (pages 60–64)
- 4 objectives for AT.L2-3.2.1 [a][b][c][d]; 3 objectives for AT.L2-3.2.2 [a][b][c]
- 7 AT-specific evidence types across both controls
- 1 AT↔AT relationship edge (AT.L2-3.2.1 is prerequisite for AT.L2-3.2.2)
- 7 cross-family edges: AT↔IR (×2), AT↔PS (×1), AT↔CA (×2), AT↔AC (×2)
- Scoring: AT.L2-3.2.1=-5 Basic, AT.L2-3.2.2=-5 Basic; both POA&M allowed
  - Confirmed from CMMC Scoring Methodology: both listed explicitly in 5-point basic requirement list
  - Neither control appears in the POA&M prohibited list
- AT added to all four family dropdowns: ControlLibrary.jsx, Home.jsx, EvidenceLookup.jsx, RelationshipExplorer.jsx
- AT registered in validator: FAMILY_FILES, FAMILY_CODE_TO_NAME, RELATIONSHIP_FILES, EVIDENCE_FILES
- Validator passes: 94 controls, 112 evidence types, 161 relationships (4 bidirectional warnings only)

**Note:** AT.L2-3.2.3 was initially omitted because PROJECT_STATE.md incorrectly listed only two AT controls. It was added in the correction pass below.

### Added — Maintenance (MA) Family
- 6 controls confirmed from CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2 (pages 149–160):
  MA.L2-3.7.1 (Perform Maintenance), MA.L2-3.7.2 (System Maintenance Control), MA.L2-3.7.3 (Equipment Sanitization), MA.L2-3.7.4 (Media Inspection), MA.L2-3.7.5 (Nonlocal Maintenance), MA.L2-3.7.6 (Maintenance Personnel)
- **PROJECT_STATE.md mismatch corrected:** Previous estimate listed range "through MA.L2-3.7.5" — MA.L2-3.7.6 was missed. All 6 controls were present in the Assessment Guide and are now implemented.
- Scoring (all confirmed from CMMC Scoring Methodology):
  - MA.L2-3.7.1: -3 Basic (explicitly in 3-point basic list)
  - MA.L2-3.7.2: -5 Basic (explicitly in 5-point basic list)
  - MA.L2-3.7.3: -1 Derived (not in 5-pt or 3-pt lists)
  - MA.L2-3.7.4: -3 Derived (explicitly in 3-point derived list)
  - MA.L2-3.7.5: -5 Derived (explicitly in 5-point derived list)
  - MA.L2-3.7.6: -1 Derived (not in 5-pt or 3-pt lists)
- POA&M: all 6 controls allowed — none appear in the prohibited POA&M list
- 8 MA-specific evidence types
- 5 intra-MA relationship edges
- 9 cross-family edges: MA↔SI (×2, Assessment Guide explicit), MA↔IA (×1, Assessment Guide explicit), MA↔AC (×2, Assessment Guide explicit), MA↔PE (×1, Assessment Guide explicit), MA↔CM (×1), MA↔IR (×1)
- MA↔MP edge (MA.L2-3.7.3 ↔ MP.L1-3.8.3) deferred until MP expansion — MP controls not yet in the dataset
- MA added to all four family dropdowns: ControlLibrary.jsx, Home.jsx, EvidenceLookup.jsx, RelationshipExplorer.jsx
- MA registered in validator: FAMILY_FILES, FAMILY_CODE_TO_NAME, RELATIONSHIP_FILES, EVIDENCE_FILES
- Validator passes: 101 controls, 122 evidence types, 175 relationships (4 bidirectional warnings only)

### Fixed — AT.L2-3.2.3 (Insider Threat Awareness) Added
- AT.L2-3.2.3 confirmed in CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2 (pages 65–66); NIST SP 800-171 R2 practice 3.2.3
- 2 objectives: [a] insider threat indicators identified, [b] awareness training provided to managers and employees
- Scoring: AT.L2-3.2.3=-1 Derived — not listed in 5-point or 3-point scoring lists; falls under "all remaining derived requirements" per CMMC Scoring Methodology
- POA&M: allowed — AT.L2-3.2.3 does not appear in the POA&M prohibited controls list
- 2 new evidence entries added: Insider Threat Awareness Training Materials and Records; Insider Threat Indicator Reference Documentation
- 1 new intra-AT relationship: AT.L2-3.2.1 supports AT.L2-3.2.3 (awareness program is the delivery vehicle for insider threat content)
- PROJECT_STATE.md corrected: AT shows 3 controls; dataset totals updated
- Validator passes: 95 controls, 114 evidence types, 162 relationships (4 warnings — unchanged)

### Added — Home Dashboard (Visual Progress Tracking)
- Stacked progress bar showing status distribution (MET / NOT MET / In Progress / Not Started)
- Family selector dropdown to filter progress stats to a specific control family
- Status count rows now link to Control Library filtered by status + family combination
- Progress bar uses existing CSS color variables; segments animate on family switch
- Empty-state handling when selected family has no controls

### Fixed — Progress Bar Rendering
- Progress bar was invisible due to missing CSS (`height: 12px` not in styles.css)
- CSS additions documented in `progress-bar-styles.css` and required manual append to `styles.css`

### Added — Inheritance Tracking
- `src/utils/inheritance.js` — INHERITANCE_VALUES, DEFAULT_INHERITANCE, INHERITANCE_BADGE_CLASS, readInheritance, writeInheritance
- Storage key: `cmmc-inheritance-{controlId}`
- ControlDetail: Inheritance dropdown alongside Assessment Status in `.control-meta-row`
- ControlLibrary: Inheritance badge (hidden when None), inheritance filter dropdown
- projectState.js: inheritance exported and imported with case-insensitive normalization
- Badge colors: None=gray, Full=purple, Partial=blue
- `FILTER_KEYS` extended to include `'inheritance'`

### Added — Multi-Select Bulk Actions (ControlLibrary)
- Checkbox column on every control row; select-all header with indeterminate state
- Bulk toolbar (visible only when selection > 0): selected count, Set Status dropdown, Set Inheritance dropdown, Clear Data button, Clear Selection button
- Bulk Set Status: writes to all selected controls, forces re-render via updateKey bump
- Bulk Set Inheritance: same pattern
- Bulk Clear Data: resets status → Not Started, inheritance → None, control note → '', all objective notes → ''
- Selection persists across filter changes and bulk actions
- Checkbox click stops propagation; row Link still navigates normally
- CSS additions: `.bulk-toolbar`, `.bulk-toolbar-*`, `.control-list-item--selected`, `.control-list-checkbox-label`, `.control-list-select-all`

### Added — Scoring and POA&M Metadata
- `src/data/scoring.json` — flat lookup keyed by control ID; fields: scoreValue, practiceType, poamAllowed, poamRestrictionReason
- `src/utils/scoring.js` — SCORE_VALUES, SCORE_BADGE_CLASS, getScore, getPracticeType, isPoamAllowed, getPoamReason, getScoringMeta, getScoringSearchTerms
- ControlLibrary: score badge `(n)`, Non-POA&M badge, score filter, POA&M filter
- Badge order: status → inheritance → notes → Non-POA&M → score
- Score and POA&M filters added to FILTER_KEYS
- Validator Category 7 (Scoring): checks every control has scoring.json entry, valid scoreValue, boolean poamAllowed, poamRestrictionReason when poamAllowed=false

### Changed — Score Badge Format
- Score badges display as `(5)`, `(3)`, `(1)` instead of raw `-5`, `-3`, `-1`
- Score filter dropdown labels updated to match: `(5) pts`, `(3) pts`, `(1) pts`
- `title` attribute retains `"5-point deduction if not met"` for tooltip context

### Removed — Scoring Section from ControlDetail

- PE.L1-3.10.3, PE.L1-3.10.4, PE.L1-3.10.5 are **non-POA&Mable** (Level 1 FAR-referenced practices)
- PE added to all family dropdowns: ControlLibrary.jsx, Home.jsx, EvidenceLookup.jsx, RelationshipExplorer.jsx
- PE registered in validator: FAMILY_FILES, FAMILY_CODE_TO_NAME, RELATIONSHIP_FILES, EVIDENCE_FILES
- Validator passes: 92 controls, 105 evidence types, 153 relationships (4 bidirectional warnings only)

### Fixed — PE Control ID Typo in PROJECT_STATE.md
- Previous note incorrectly listed non-POA&Mable PE controls as PE.L2-3.10.3/4/5
- Corrected to PE.L1-3.10.3, PE.L1-3.10.4, PE.L1-3.10.5 per Assessment Guide
- L1 designation confirmed: all three carry FAR Clause 52.204-21 Partial b.1.ix reference

### Fixed — RelationshipExplorer and EvidenceLookup Family Dropdowns
- Personnel Security and Physical Protection options were missing or had malformed JSX option labels
- Corrected during PE integration; all four UI files now have consistent family lists

### Changed — Family Expansion Process (Standardized)
- All family expansions now use micro-patches (UI-PATCHES-{FAMILY}.md) rather than full page rewrites for page files
- Each expansion produces: controls JSON, evidence JSON, relationships JSON, cross-family patch JSON, scoring patch JSON, updated index.js files, updated validator, UI patch instructions
- Validator runs after every merge to confirm exit 0

### Changed — Validator
- Category 7 (Scoring) added: validates scoreValue ∈ {-1,-3,-5}, poamAllowed is boolean, poamRestrictionReason present when poamAllowed=false
- Extra scoring.json entries (future families not yet in controls) produce warnings not failures
- All 11 completed families registered in FAMILY_FILES and FAMILY_CODE_TO_NAME
